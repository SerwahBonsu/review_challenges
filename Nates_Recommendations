1. Defining classes
  a. instance variables
  b. @foo vs. attr_reader :foo
2. Initializing instances of a class
  a. pass args, number of arguments or as hash
3. Composition

4. Hash syntax (=> vs ':')
5. How an instance & class relate
7. Reasons for Array vs Hash
9. Picking the 'best' enumerable method

Deliverables:
You want a cheat sheet with my notes
Runnable code that demonstrates the context.
>>Make a .rb file that demonstrates these challenges
